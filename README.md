# Simple Todo App

The Todo App allows users to easily write their list of to-dos and "do" as many things as the need to.

## Functionality

This app allows users to create their own specific items, offers a possible due date, and of course allows them to check each item off their list one by one.

## Technology

Utilizing JavaScript to make the checkboxes responsive for the specific entry of the user. By using a class with constructors we were able to pull the date from the data constructor and use this for the event listeners as well. This app uses a variety of buttons - toggle for the checkboxes, submit for creating a new to-do, and a delete button for items you don't really need to-do. There is also validity checking the inputs and error messages will appear if the requirements are not completed.
